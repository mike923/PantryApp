## ðŸš¨ Setting up your enviroment ðŸš¨

- Follow the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) setup docs

- Download Simulators (Xcode only avaliable on iOS)

  - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5bPP9obN6AIVip-fCh3PggusEAAYASAAEgIyRfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

## Running iOS simulator on your iOS device

- Once you've downloaded Xcode signup for an [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/).
- Select your project in the Xcode Project Navigator, then select your main target (it should share the same name as your project)
- Look for the "General" tab. Go to "Signing" and make sure your Apple developer account or team is selected under the Team dropdown.
- Do the same for the tests target (it ends with Tests, and is below your main target).
- Repeat this step for the Tests target in your project.
